# LeetCode Problem Solving Rules

## General Approach

When helping with LeetCode problems:

1. **README.md Format**
   - Always write problem descriptions in English
   - Include full problem statement with examples and constraints
   - Keep it concise - ONLY the problem description, no solution explanations

2. **Code Style**
   - Write clean, production-ready code WITHOUT comments
   - Code should be LeetCode-compatible (can submit directly)
   - Local execution is NOT a priority - focus on LeetCode submission format

3. **Teaching Style**
   - Explain logic and approach OUTSIDE the code (in conversation)
   - Act as a teacher - provide detailed explanations of algorithms
   - Show time/space complexity analysis

## Language-Specific Rules

### Rust
- Use LeetCode's required format: `impl Solution { pub fn ... }`
- DO NOT include `struct Solution;` in solution files (LeetCode provides it)
- DO NOT add `main()` function unless specifically requested for local testing
- NO comments in code - explain separately
- Focus on idiomatic Rust patterns
- ALWAYS run `rustfmt` on solution files before finishing

### File Structure
- `solution.rs` - clean LeetCode submission code
- `README.md` - problem description only

## Response Style
- Keep responses concise and direct
- Don't apologize excessively
- Suggest alternatives when relevant
- Prioritize technical details over explanations
- Limit scope of changes - avoid large refactors

## Key Points
- NEVER add comments to solution code
- NEVER include extra setup code unless requested
- ALWAYS explain algorithm logic separately from code
- ALWAYS ensure code is ready for direct LeetCode submission
